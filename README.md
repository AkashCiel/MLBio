Prediction of patient state (remission or blast crisis) post TKI therapy in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia

The attached .rmd file contains workflow for processing a gene-expression dataset (batch effect removal and log correction) and training/testing a Random Forest and an SVM model post that. For visualisation purposes, UMAP and PCA have been used for Random Forest and SVM, respectively. 
The problem statement was prediction of patient state (remission or blast-crisis) post TKI therapy in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Please refer to the section 2.2.3 and 3.3 of the attached report for more details and results.
